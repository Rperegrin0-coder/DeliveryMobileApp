Participate in the development of a mobile application in Java using Android Studio, aimed at promoting sustainable delivery options within Nottingham. This project features two user types: requestors needing parcel delivery and helpers who use eco-friendly methods such as bicycles, walking, and electric scooters. I implemented a reward system to incentivize helpers to reduce their carbon footprint, offering discounts at local shops, thereby encouraging sustainable delivery practices.
